Once installed Services can be managed like below:
   "Managing the Service"

# stop the local node
sudo service rabbitmq-server stop

# start it back
sudo service rabbitmq-server start

service rabbitmq-server status will report service status as observed by systemd (or similar service manager):

# check on service status as observed by service manager
sudo service rabbitmq-server status

Using Utility Command line tools:
# checks if the local node is running and CLI tools can successfully authenticate with it
sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics ping

# prints enabled components (applications), TCP listeners, memory usage breakdown, alarms
# and so on
sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics status

# prints effective node configuration
sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics environment

# performs a more extensive health check of the local node
sudo rabbitmq-diagnostics node_health_check
