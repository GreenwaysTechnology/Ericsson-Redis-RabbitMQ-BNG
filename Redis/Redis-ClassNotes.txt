Redis is nosql Database.

Types of NoSql database
- Key-Value
- Document 
- Column Family
- Graph 

-MultiModel


Relational databse stores data in the form of tables(columns +rows)

 Column is a mapper for storing data.

In Relational model : schema(plan) is fixed.

NoSql schema is dynamic/flexible.

Redis is at core level is KEY-VALUE database.

Redis can be fine tuned for other patterns like document oriented
  Redis can be used like mongo.

 Redis has concept called "Redis Modules" which is plugable architecture , where we can plug
 Modules on top of redis to extends Redis core functionality.


"Redis is a multimodel database enabling search, messaging, streaming, graph,
and other capabilities beyond that of a simple data store"



RedisModules:

->RedisSearch - fast searching patterns
->RedisGraph - Graph db pattern 
->RedisJSON - Document oriented pattern
->pub-Sub- Message Queue
->Streaming - storing stream based data.

Note: You can create your own modules,custom modules and can be integrated with Redis.

Where redis stores data?

 Redis was developed to store data inside RAM Only. so that redis is called as "IN memory".
 
What about machine restarts after storing data?
   All data will be lost.

What about duablity?

 Redis has concept persistency

 Redis stores /takes snapshot of data inside disk file called "fileName.rdb" or "fileName.aof"


Redis server is program, which can be started without any input- redis starts with default configuration.

Redis high level configuration:

 Redis offers lot of configuration files

->redis-conf
->sentinel.conf

 1.Via config file
     redis.config
      port 7777
 2.Via Commandline
      $redis-server --port 7777
 

Note:
 Redis stores data inside heap memory of redis process, in turn they maintain structure called
 "redis-database" which is memory layout for storing key-values

 by default redis offers 16 segment of database.

 Which can be selected by using a command "select" from redis cli

 $ select 1
 $ select 10

Programming with Redis:
......................
 Redis stores data in memory using data structure.

Data is stored inside redis using data type like rdbms sql column types.

sql 

 create table customer(id number,name varchar2(10);

in redis key-value

key has type

value has type

key type :

  string: binary safe: 
    not only characters but you can store binary/byte representation.
in general key is string.

value type:
 »»Strings
 »»Lists
 »»Sets
 »»Sorted sets
 »»Hashes
 »»Bit arrays
 »»Streams
 »»HyperLogLogs

Syntax
  key value 

  Note: redis has no Explicit type.

 How to represent type of a value.

  -> based on input(data)
       string and numbers
       hello    1

 ->via command
    rpush value
         It stores data inside List data structure

 how to send /get  Data?
  
   commands: 
     commands are classified based on data type.
....................................***************........................................

How do i send command?

 Via Client Programms.

Redis offers a client program called "redis-cli" through which you can send commands.

Redis architecture defines client-server paradigm.
     Redis uses request-reponse model.

  In web env
   Client(browser)---send request----------->webserver
                  <-------response-----------
                      using HTTP Channel
  In redis
   Redis client ----send request(set of commands) ----Redis server
		<--------response(Reply)-------------
			Using TCP/IP protocal


  Redis clients:
   Redis has been extended with various programming languages
  Java,Javascript,python,c++,C#,go......

  Every programming lanugage offers "Drivers" to connect redis
 
			
............................................................................................

Strings

1.Redis Strings are binary safe, this means that a Redis string can contain any kind of data, for instance a JPEG image or a serialized Ruby/JSON object.
2.A String value can be at max 512 Megabytes in length
3.String is collection of bits :
   

 "Internally string is array of bits:Byte array".

 Replication:

    Replication means that while you write to a Redis instance (usually referred to as the
master), it will ensure that one or more instances (usually referred to as the slaves)
become exact copies of the master.

    Clone of the Process:
			->Replication
    Copy of the Process :

   At Operating system level clone(replica) is created by "Forking" the process.

   The Orginal Process is called : Master
   Cloned Process is called : Slave

 Redis Replication works based on "copying data from Master node(instance)" to Child(slave)
 node Peridically.

  Redis uses "copy-on-write algorthim":  pure function: lambda calculs.


"Redis 2.8 introduced asynchronous replication, which makes slaves periodically
acknowledge the amount of data to be processed. As you would expect, a master
can have multiple slaves and slaves can also accept connections from other slaves.

 

  Mode of replication:
  1.sync
     client----writes data --master ---replication starts---slave 
       while replication master is blocked, if master blocked, client blocked.
  2.Async
     client----writes data --master ---replication starts---slave 
       while replication master is never blocked, if master never blocked, client never      blocked.

Note: internally master and slaves connected and communicated via TCP/IP protocal.  

Lab : Setting up basic master-slave architecture.

There are three ways of making a Redis server instance a slave:

• Add the directive slaveof IP PORT to the configuration file and start a Redis
server using this configuration

• Use the redis-server command-line option --slaveof IP PORT

• Use the command SLAVEOF IP PORT

Why replication?  :  Improve Performance

   Inside writing and reading to and from on single server
   we can spilt one server for writing and another for reading



Why replication?  :  scalability

                              
    Replicas are widely used for scalability purposes so that all read operations are
handled by replicas and the master handles only write operations.

Caution :
   Data redundancy is another reason for having multiple replicas.

Key Points:(best Practices)

    1.Persistence can be moved to the replicas so that the master does not perform disk
I/O operations.

   "It is possible to improve data consistency guarantees by requiring a minimum
number of replicas connected to the master server. 

   "In this way, all write operations
are only executed in the master Redis server if the minimum number of replicas
are satisfied, along with their maximum replication lag (in seconds)."

 
Fail-over and Replicas:
.....................

      Replicas are very useful in a master failure scenario because they contain all of
the most recent data and can be promoted to master


Redis can be executed in single instance mode by default.


Unfortunately, when Redis is running in single-instance mode, there is no automatic failover to promote a slave to master.


How to Promote SLAVE To Master and handle failures 

1.Using commands mannually
2.Using automatic failover handling.

All replicas and clients connected to the old master need to be reconfigured

  converts a slave into a master instance, and it should be used in a failover scenario.

The next example assumes there is a master on port 5555 and there are two slaves
on ports 6666 and 7777, respectively. 

If the master instance is offline (crashed or
maintenance window), it may be required that one of its replicas become a master.
In this situation, all connected replicas and clients need to be reconfigured.

The following snippet causes a crash in the master instance (port 5555), configures
one of the slaves to become a master, and reconfigures the second slave to replicate
the new master:



These are admin tasks

$ redis-cli -p 5555 DEBUG SEGFAULT
$ redis-cli -p 6666 SLAVEOF NO ONE
$ redis-cli -p 7777 SLAVEOF 127.0.0.1 6666

once done , test using redis-cli


Check the new replication configuration is working:
$ redis-cli -p 6666 SET newkey newvalue
OK
$ redis-cli -p 7777 GET newkey

Partitioning:

Partitioning is a general term used to describe the act of breaking up data and
distributing it across different hosts.

Types of partioning:
 There are two types of partitioning:
  >> horizontal partitioning 
  >> vertical partitioning.

Why?
Partitioning is performed in a cluster of hosts when better performance, maintainability, or availability is desired.

• Use the redis-server command-line option --slaveof IP PORT
• Use the command SLAVEOF IP PORT



Steps:
The following example starts three Redis instances: one master and two replicas.

On the first terminal, start the master redis-server on port 5555:

$ redis-server --port 5555
  On the second terminal, start the first slave on port 6666:

$ redis-server --port 6666 --slaveof 127.0.0.1 5555

On the third terminal, start the second slave on port 7777:
$ redis-server --port 7777 --slaveof 127.0.0.1 5555
At this point, there is a master with two replicas running.

On the fourth terminal, check whether the replication is working:
$ redis-cli -p 5555 SET testkey testvalue
OK
$ redis-cli -p 6666 GET testkey
"testvalue"
$ redis-cli -p 7777 GET testkey
"testvalue"

Partitioning:

Partitioning is a general term used to describe the act of breaking up data and

Types of partioning:
 There are two types of partitioning:
  >> horizontal partitioning 
  >> vertical partitioning.
Why?
Partitioning is performed in a cluster of hosts when better performance, maintainability, or availability is desired.

When Redis was initially designed, it had no intention to be a distributed data store;
thus, it cannot natively distribute its data among different instances. It was designed
to work well on a single server. Redis Cluster is designed to solve distributed problems
in Redis.

Over time, Redis storage may grow to such an extent that a single server may not
be enough to store all of the data. The performance of reading from and writing to
a single server may also decline.

As we saw in the previous section, we can use replicas to optimize reads and remove
some bottlenecks from the master instance, but in many cases, this is not enough.
Different needs require different approaches, and here are some situations that we
did not provide information on how to handle yet:

• The total data to be stored is larger than the total memory available in a
Redis server
• The network bandwidth is not enough to handle all of the traffic

 We will show some solutions to the problems listed in the preceding list using
the concept of partitioning

Partitioning Implementations:
............................

1.Client side

   Where,single-instance mode and  Redis does not support partitioning
  or clustering

2.Server side 
   Using a proxy or a query routing system
        -Clustering


>> horizontal partitioning :  
  Horizontal partitioning means  distributing keys across different Redis instances.

For example, if you have two Redis Sets stored in
Redis, horizontal partitioning would distribute each Set entirely to a different Redis
instance

>> vertical partitioning
  While vertical partitioning means distributing key values
across different Redis instances

 while vertical partitioning would distribute the Set's values to different
instances.

  Each kind of partitioning has its purpose.

 Horizontal partitioning (also known as "sharding") is the most popular approach adopted with   Redis


Horizontal partitioning Techniques:
...................................

Range Partitioning:
..................

Range partitioning is very simple; data is distributed based on a range of keys.
Assuming that the keys you want to partition are based on incremental IDs, you
can create numerical ranges to partition the data. 

For example, assuming that you have a group of users identified by IDs (such as user:1, user:2, and so on up to user:5000) you can split these IDs into ranges of thousands.

Then you can send keys that go from 1 to 1000 to a given instance, 1001 to 2000 to a different instance, 2001 to 3000 to another instance, and so on


Another Eg:

A different approach would be to partition the data based on the first letter of
each key, so you would send all keys that go from A to G to one instance, H to O
to another instance, and P to Z to a third instance. This logic would partition the
data into three ranges, and each range would be stored in a different host

    "The whole idea of range partitioning is to create ranges of keys and distribute
them to different Redis instances. You can be creative in how you create the
range selection."


Drawbacks of Range Partitioning:

1.A downside to this type of partitioning is that the distributions will probably be
uneven—one range may be much larger than others. 
 
For example, if you decide to
distribute the keys based on their first letter but you do not have a good distribution
of key names (that is, most of your keys are in the same range or some ranges have
very few keys), you are going to end up with a very uneven distribution that does
not take full advantage of partitioning

Another downside is that this does not accommodate changing the list of Redis hosts
easily, because if the number of Redis instances changes, the range distribution needs
to change accordingly. It is likely that adding or removing a host will invalidate a
good portion of data

Implementation: u can write code at client side : may be js code


Hash partitioning:
.................

Hash partitioning is a little more elaborate than range partitioning, and it does not
have the range partitioning method's downside of uneven data partitioning

Hash partitioning is very well known, and everyone who manages Memcached at scale is
familiar with it.


Hash partitioning is very simple to implement. It consists of finding the instance to
send the commands by applying a hash function to the Redis key, dividing this hash
value by the number of Redis instances available, and using the remainder of that
division as the instance index.

A JavaScript snippet may exemplify this idea better than English:
var index = hashFunction(redisKey) % redisHosts.length;
var host = redisHosts[index];

The efficiency of this method varies with the hash function you choose. If your hash
function is good for your dataset, it will create even partitions. It is very common for
people to use MD5 and SHA1 as hash functions.

eg:write js files

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Implementations of Redis partitioning:
.......................................
• The client layer is the application layer, such as what we implemented in the
previous examples.
• The proxy layer is an extra layer that proxies all Redis queries and performs
partitioning for applications. When a proxy is used, the client layer does not
even need to know that partitioning is taking place.
An example of this layer is the twemproxy program,

• The query router layer is something that is invisible to the application.
However, it is not an external program; it is the data store itself. Any
command issued to any Redis instance will succeed with this layer, because
the Redis instance itself will make sure that the command is routed to the
appropriate instance in its cluster. Redis Cluster behaves like a query router


Twemproxy : if you want you can use this, developed by twitter,and open sourced

Cluster:


Introduction:

Redis was initially designed to be very lightweight and fast. Previously, the only topology available for anyone using Redis was master/slave, in which the master receives all the writes and replicates the changes to the slave (or slaves). This happens without any sort of automatic failover or data sharding. This topology works well in many scenarios, such as when:
•
The master has enough memory to store all of the data that you need
•
More slaves can be added to scale reads better or when network bandwidth is a problem (the total read volume is higher than the hardware capability)
•
It is acceptable to stop your application when maintenance is required on the master machine
•
Data redundancy through slaves is enough


But it does not work well in other scenarios, such as when:
•The dataset is bigger than the available memory in the master Redis instance
•A given application cannot be stopped when there are issues with the
master instance
•You need to distribute data among multiple nodes
•A single point of failure is not acceptable


History:

 In 2011, Salvatore Sanfilippo started working on a project that would solve these
problems, but Redis was still underdeveloped. He decided to stop his work because
of requests from the community to support other features, such as persistence, better
data types, introspection, and replication. In 2011, he did not have a lot of knowledge
about distributed systems, and Redis Cluster was a complex project to create. It was
a great idea, but it required more experience than he had at that time. Solving all of
these problems was a difficult task, so he decided to tackle only automatic failover
and created a project called Redis Sentinel.


Redis-Cluster Project Vs Redis Sentinel:
.......................................
Redis Sentinel and Redis Cluster share a lot of characteristics, but each has its own
goal. Sentinel's goal is to provide reliable automatic failover in a master/slave
topology without sharding data.

 Cluster's goal is to distribute data across different
Redis instances and perform automatic failover if any problem happens to any
master instance.

Redis Sentinel became stable in Redis 2.8 in late 2013, and Redis Cluster became
stable in Redis 3.0 in early 2015.



The CAP theorem:
................

Most distributed systems are generally analyzed using the CAP theorem, which
states that a distributed system cannot ensure all of the following:

• Consistency: A read operation is guaranteed to return the most recent write

• Availability: Any operation is guaranteed to receive a response saying
whether it has succeeded or failed

• Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate when a network
partition occurs

Since Redis Sentinel and Redis Cluster are distributed systems, it is fair to analyze
them using the CAP theorem. Network partitions are unavoidable in a distributed
system, so it should ensure either consistency or availability; that is, it should be
either CP or AP.


Naturally:

Theoretically, Redis Sentinel and Redis Cluster are neither consistent nor available
under network partitions. However, there are some configurations that can minimize
the consistency and availability problems.

They cannot provide availability because there is a "quorum" that needs to agree on
a master election, and depending on the quorum's decision, part of the system may
become unavailable.

They cannot provide consistency under network partitions, for example, when two
or more partitions accept writes at the same time. When the network heals and the
partitions are joined, some of those writes will be lost (conflicts are not automatically
solved, nor are they exposed for clients).


Redis Cluster:
Redis Cluster was designed to automatically shard data across different Redis
instances, providing some degree of availability during network partitions.


there aretwo ports that Redis uses.
The first is used to serve clients (low port), and the second
serves as a bus for node-to-node communication (high port).
The high port is used to exchange messages such as failure detection, failover, resharding, and so on.

The Redis Cluster bus uses a binary protocol to exchange messages between nodes.
The low port is specified in the configuration, and Redis assigns the high port by
adding 10,000 to the low port.


For example, if a Redis server starts listening to port
6379 (low port) in cluster mode, it will internally assign port 16379 (high port) for
node-to-node communication.

The Redis Cluster topology is a full mesh network

 A mesh network (or simply meshnet) is a local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes (i.e. bridges, switches, and other infrastructure devices) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients.

All nodes are interconnected through Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections


Redis Cluster requires at least three masters,It is recommended that you have at least one replica per master. Otherwise, if any 	master node without at least one replica fails, the data will be lost:

when a failover is happening in Redis Cluster, only the keys
in the slots assigned to the failed master are unavailable until a replica is promoted.
The data may be unavailable during a failover, because slave promotion is not
instantaneous.


When Redis is in cluster mode, its interface is slightly changed. This requires a smarter
client. When connecting to Redis through redis-cli, the -c parameter is required to
enable cluster mode.

Connect server in cluster mode:

redis-cli -c -h localhost -p 6379

Cluster and Partitioning:

Hash slots:
The partitioning method used to shard data by Redis Cluster is similar to the hash
partitioning

 In Redis Cluster, that fixed value is 16,384. Redis calls this method hash slot. 
Each master in a cluster owns a portion of the 16,384 slots.

Use the create-cluster start command to initialize six Redis instances:



Steps:
........

1.create cluster

redis-server --port 5000 --cluster-enabled yes --cluster-config-file
nodes-5000.conf --cluster-node-timeout 2000 --cluster-slave-validityfactor
10 --cluster-migration-barrier 1 --cluster-require-full-coverage
yes --dbfilename dump-5000.rdb --daemonize no

redis-server --port 5001 --cluster-enabled yes --cluster-config-file
nodes-5001.conf --cluster-node-timeout 2000 --cluster-slave-validityfactor
10 --cluster-migration-barrier 1 --cluster-require-full-coverage
yes --dbfilename dump-5001.rdb --daemonize no


redis-server --port 5002 --cluster-enabled yes --cluster-config-file
nodes-5002.conf --cluster-node-timeout 2000 --cluster-slave-validityfactor
10 --cluster-migration-barrier 1 --cluster-require-full-coverage
yes --dbfilename dump-5002.rdb --daemonize no


2.Test cluster state

$ redis-cli -c -p 5000
127.0.0.1:5000> CLUSTER INFO


127.0.0.1:5000> CLUSTER INFO
cluster_state:fail
cluster_slots_assigned:0
cluster_slots_ok:0
cluster_slots_pfail:0
cluster_slots_fail:0
cluster_known_nodes:1
cluster_size:0
cluster_current_epoch:0
cluster_my_epoch:0
cluster_stats_messages_sent:0
cluster_stats_messages_received:0
127.0.0.1:5000> SET foo bar
(error) CLUSTERDOWN The cluster is down


The output of CLUSTER INFO tells us that the cluster only knows about one node
(the connected node), no slots are assigned to any of the nodes, and the cluster state
is fail.
When the cluster is in the fail state, it cannot process any queries, as we could see
when we tried to execute the SET command.
Next, the 16,384 hash slots are distributed evenly across the three instances.
The configuration cluster-require-full-coverage is set to yes, which means that the
cluster can process queries only if all hash slots are assigned to running instances:

$ redis-cli -c -p 5000 CLUSTER ADDSLOTS {0..5460}
$ redis-cli -c -p 5001 CLUSTER ADDSLOTS {5461..10922}
$ redis-cli -c -p 5002 CLUSTER ADDSLOTS {10923..16383}


The CLUSTER ADDSLOTS command informs the node what slots it should own.
If a hash slot is already assigned, this command fails. It is possible to assign slots one
by one; it does not need to be a sequence of numbers.


At this point, the hash slots are distributed evenly across the nodes, but the cluster is
not ready yet. The cluster nodes still do not know about each other.
In Redis Cluster, there is a concept called configuration epoch, which is a number that
represents the cluster state at a particular point in time.


When a cluster is initially created, the configuration epoch is set to 0 for each master.
We can change this to help Redis start the cluster in a safe way. This is the only
time when the configuration epoch should be changed manually. Redis Cluster
automatically changes the configuration after it is up and running:

$ redis-cli -c -p 5000 CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH 1
$ redis-cli -c -p 5001 CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH 2
$ redis-cli -c -p 5002 CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH 3

This example executes the command CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH to manually
set an incremental epoch to each node, which is good practice when starting a new
cluster. In this example, there is no conflicting information. However, if there was
conflicting information (for example, if two different nodes claimed the same hash
slots), the largest epoch configuration would have priority.


Next, we are going to make all the nodes aware of each other. We will do this using
the command CLUSTER MEET:
$ redis-cli -c -p 5000 CLUSTER MEET 127.0.0.1 5001
$ redis-cli -c -p 5000 CLUSTER MEET 127.0.0.1 5002


It is not necessary to execute CLUSTER MEET on each node to notify it about the
existence of all the other nodes. When the first node meets the second, it means that
the second node also knows about the first, and they can exchange information about
other nodes that they know. When the first node meets the third node, all three
nodes will know about each other eventually, through the gossip protocol that Redis
Cluster implements.


 " gossip protocol is a procedure or process of computer peer-to-peer communication that is based on the way epidemics spread. Some distributed systems use peer-to-peer gossip to ensure that data is disseminated to all members of a group."

Run the command CLUSTER INFO to see that the cluster is up and running:
$ redis-cli -c -p 5000
127.0.0.1:5000> CLUSTER INFO
cluster_state:ok
cluster_slots_assigned:16384
cluster_slots_ok:16384
cluster_slots_pfail:0
cluster_slots_fail:0
cluster_known_nodes:3
cluster_size:3
cluster_current_epoch:3
cluster_my_epoch:1
cluster_stats_messages_sent:164
cluster_stats_messages_received:144
127.0.0.1:5000> SET hello world
OK


As you can see, CLUSTER INFO reports that the cluster state is ok, all 16,384 hash
slots are assigned, the current configuration epoch is 3, and the cluster knows about
three nodes.



Adding slaves/replicas:

There are three master nodes but no slaves. Thus, no data is replicated anywhere.
This is not very safe. Data can be lost, and if any master has issues, the entire cluster
will be unavailable (cluster-require-full-coverage is set to yes).
A new slave/replica can be added to the cluster by:
• Creating a new Redis instance in cluster mode
• Introducing it to the current cluster using the command CLUSTER MEET
• Getting the node ID of the master that will be replicated using the command
CLUSTER NODES
• Executing the command CLUSTER REPLICATE to replicate a given node

Create a new Redis instance in cluster mode:


$ redis-server --port 5003 --cluster-enabled yes --cluster-config-file
nodes-5003.conf --cluster-node-timeout 2000 --cluster-slave-validityfactor
10 --cluster-migration-barrier 1 --cluster-require-full-coverage
yes --dbfilename dump-5003.rdb --daemonize yes


Introduce it to the current cluster using the command CLUSTER MEET:
$ redis-cli -c -p 5003 CLUSTER MEET 127.0.0.1 5000
Get the node ID of the master that is going to be replicated by using the command


CLUSTER NODES:
$ redis-cli -c -p 5003 CLUSTER NODES

b5354de29d7ec02e64580658d3f59422cfeda916 127.0.0.1:5002 master - 0

The command CLUSTER NODES outputs a list with all the nodes that belong to
the cluster, along with their properties. Every line follows this format: <node-id>
<ip:port> <flags> <master> <ping-sent> <pong-recv> <config-epoch> <link-state> <slots>.


Let's replicate the instance running on port 5000. The output shows that the node ID
for this instance is f5940c6bcd6f06abb07f7d480b16630b6a597424.

Since the node ID is generated randomly using /dev/urandom, all CLUSTER NODES
outputs in our examples are merely for demonstration.

Execute the command CLUSTER REPLICATE to replicate a given node:
$ redis-cli -c -p 5003 CLUSTER REPLICATE
f5940c6bcd6f06abb07f7d480b16630b6a597424


The replica is ready and CLUSTER NODES can confirm this:

$ redis-cli -c -p 5003 CLUSTER NODES

b5354de29d7ec02e64580658d3f59422cfeda916 127.0.0.1:5002 master - 0

1432276451800 1 connected 0-5460

The first output line is the slave information. It said myself,master previously, and
after CLUSTER REPLICATE, it became myself,slave.
